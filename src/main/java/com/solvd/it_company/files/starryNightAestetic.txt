The Starry Night aesthetic is created by Van Gogh's use of color,
light, and brushstrokes. For this oil on canvas painting,
Van Gogh applied the paint directly to the canvas, resulting in very intense color
and paint that stands up off the canvas' surface. The top two-thirds of the canvas
is the night sky, with a small town nestled between the Alpilles mountains and an olive grove.
The sky is full of energy created by short, circular brushstrokes of intense blue around glowing
yellow and white circular stars and a crescent moon. The morning star, just to the left of center,
glows brightest. The blue of the sky is blended into the black mountains. There is a large cypress
tree on the left in the foreground that moves and sways with the same energy as the sky. It has been
described as flame-like. The cypress reaches almost the entire height of the painting.
The small village in the center is a juxtaposition, with straight brushstrokes in muted greys and blacks.
The church spire reaches into the sky, mirroring the cypress tree. Yellow lights glow from the village windows.
The church is notably dark, with no light shining from its windows. It is the sky that draws the eye, with its energy,
swirling movement, and dream-like quality.
